# Image-Feature-Extraction-Using-GenAI
This project implements an advanced generative AI pipeline for extracting and rating features from images. It combines the power of Florence-2, a state-of-the-art vision-language model, with a fine-tuned version of Mistral-v3, a cutting-edge large language model.
